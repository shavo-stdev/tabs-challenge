I've decided to use Vite for building and running project along with React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

Accessibility
keyboard-only users can change between tabs by pressing Tab key and Shift + Tab key and can select tab by hitting Enter Key and can change focus on the list and scroll with arrow keys

Browser support
React supports all popular browsers and For this Project i have added Css Prefix to .css files that both latest and older browser will be supported

Reusability
I have created reusable componets for tabs and loader and each components might contains of small components which can be easier to use and modify 


type return useefect
should use React.FC or not ?
